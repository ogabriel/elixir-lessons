there is two different file extensiosn:

.ex
compiled code, when compiled it will generate .beam files,
which is the bytecode for the erlang machine understands
for the compilation you use: elixirc file.ex
* that is just valid for modules, if the was a module inside that,
it will generate Elixir.Module.beam, for futher use

.exs

interpreted code, you dont have to recompile
everytime that you have to run it, because
it has to reparse everything
when you run the exs with elixir file.exs it
will only be available at the memory

you can even read a file in the iex console with:
c("file.ex/exs")
